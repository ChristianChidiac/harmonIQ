# HarmonIQ

Websites such as Whisperify and statsForSpotify utilize the Spotify web API to generate quizzes and display user listening history, but neither of these sites have the ability to add songs to shared playlists. Spotify does offer a feature to create shared playlists but it does not allow the users to vote on the songs that they want to add to the playlists. Even though it offers Spotify Wrapped at the end of each year, a user is not able to see their listening history over a timeline during the rest of the year.

HarmonIQ will provide the user with entertainment in the form of quizzes, and it will also allow them to add songs to a crowdsourced playlists, see their listening history on a timeline, find concerts in their area and share their passion for music with their friends and family.

The target audience for our web app is anyone passionate about music. HarmonIQ is intended to allow people, who love music, to enjoy and share their passion with each other.

HarmonIQ has many different individual features, including displaying user statistics and listening history, generating quizzes based on the users’ music taste, adding songs to shared playlists, and finding nearby concerts.

Some of the epics are as followed:

1. The user can login with Spotify to view their listening history by artist and genre.
2. The user can take a quiz based on music clips, lyrics, or album covers from their favorite artists and see how well they did in comparison to other users.
3. The user can vote to add or play songs in a shared playlist.
4. The user can see upcoming concerts in their area of their favorite artists.
5. The user sees a new fun fact about music, artists, albums etc. everyday

We think that the wide assortment of features we plan to implement, including displaying user listening stats and history, generating quizzes based on the users’ musical taste, allowing the user to vote on songs to be added and played from shared playlists, as well as seeing nearby concerts of the users’ favorite artists, will definitely be enough work for five people.
